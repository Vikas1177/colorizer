# IMAGE COLORIZER
This project implements an image colorizer that converts black and white (grayscale) images into RGB (color) images. The model architecture is inspired by the paper Image Colorization using Generative Adversarial Networks.

## Features
- Converts black and white images to colorized RGB outputs
- Uses a GAN-based architecture for realistic colorization

Includes sample results showcasing the model's performance
